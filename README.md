Got it — you’d like your **User Management API System** documentation rewritten into plain human-friendly language without emojis, stars, hyphens, or exclamations. I’ve cleaned and restructured it so it reads smoothly, almost like a professional product guide.

User Management API System

This is a complete Node.js backend application that handles user registration, login, and account management. It includes secure authentication, input validation, and reliable database storage.

What This System Does

The User Management API provides a backend foundation for any application that needs user accounts. It takes care of everything related to user data, from creating new accounts to logging users in and securely managing their information.

Main Features

User registration with email and password
Secure login with password verification
Complete user management (create, read, update, delete)
Administrative controls for managing all users
Encrypted password storage for security
Automatic input validation
Permanent database storage
RESTful API endpoints that connect easily to any frontend

Technology Used

Node.js for server-side programming
Express.js for building API routes
TypeORM for database management
SQLite for storing user information
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication
Bcrypt for password encryption
Express Validator for input validation and error checking

How the Application is Organized

The codebase is structured into logical folders so each part of the system is easy to find and maintain:

src/
• server.js – Main application entry point
• config – Database and environment settings
• controllers – Business logic for authentication and user management
• middleware – Security checks for authentication
• models – User data structure
• routes – API routes for authentication and user management
• scripts – Database setup and testing tools
• tests – Automated tests
• utils – Helpers for password encryption and input validation

API Endpoints

Authentication
• POST /api/auth/register – Create a new account
• POST /api/auth/login – Login with email and password

User Management
• GET /api/users – List all users (admin only)
• GET /api/users/:id – Get information about a specific user
• PUT /api/users/:id – Update user profile
• DELETE /api/users/:id – Remove a user account
• PATCH /api/users/:id/password – Change password

System Information
• GET /api/health – Check server status
• GET / – Overview of API documentation

What Each Component Does

server.js is the main application controller. It starts the system, connects to the database, and handles requests.

authController.js manages registration and login, verifies credentials, and ensures passwords are secure.

userController.js manages user data including profiles, updates, and account deletion.

auth.js is middleware that checks whether users are logged in and have the correct permissions.

User.js defines the structure of user information including name, email, password, and role.

Database Setup

The application uses SQLite, which is automatically created on startup. It is lightweight, requires no separate server, and stores everything in a single file.

Security Features

All passwords are encrypted with bcrypt before being saved. Original passwords are never stored.
JWT tokens handle authentication and expire after 24 hours.
Input is validated to prevent errors and vulnerabilities.
An admin role allows management of all users, while regular users can only access their own data.

Getting Started

Requirements: Node.js version 16 or higher and npm installed.

Installation:

1. Open the Node folder in your terminal
2. Run npm install to install dependencies
3. Run npm start to start the server
4. The server runs on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

For development mode, use npm run dev to enable automatic restart on code changes.

Environment Configuration

The system uses environment variables for flexible configuration such as database connection details, server port, and JWT secret keys.

Testing the API

You can test with Postman, curl, frontend applications, or the built-in test scripts.

Example requests:

Register a new user
POST /api/auth/register
{ "email": "[user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com)", "password": "securepassword", "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe" }

Login user
POST /api/auth/login
{ "email": "[user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com)", "password": "securepassword" }

Get all users (admin only)
GET /api/users with a valid JWT token in the Authorization header

Real World Applications

This system is suitable for:
• Web applications such as e-commerce, social platforms, online services, and education systems
• Mobile app backends for iOS, Android, or PWAs
• Business tools like employee management systems, CRM platforms, or client portals

Error Handling and Logging

The system provides clear error messages, proper HTTP status codes, detailed logs for debugging, and graceful handling of database issues.

Database Management

Included scripts initialize the database, view data, and test registration. Data is saved in SQLite and persists across server restarts.

Scalability and Performance

The application can handle multiple concurrent users, thousands of accounts, and high-frequency requests. It can be deployed on services such as Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, Railway, or any Node.js hosting platform.

What You Have Built

A professional backend system with:
• Complete user lifecycle management from registration to deletion
• Secure authentication with encrypted passwords and token-based access
• A well-structured, RESTful API ready for frontend integration
• Comprehensive error handling and testing capabilities
• Modular, scalable architecture for real-world use

This backend demonstrates the ability to create secure, maintainable, and production-ready systems that power user management in modern applications.
